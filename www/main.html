        <p>The LORD will open the heavens, the storehouse of his bounty, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. (Deuteronomy 28:12) 
Wow! The Lord will open the heavens above us all this month of March.
 
As we experience the works of God this year, let’s communicate the Word of God to others who don’t know the Lord. 
This is a month of avid soul winning. 
Let us go into the world and preach the kingdom of God to the dying world. Let’s connect them to their original source. (i.e. God) 
Remember the King is waiting at the porch for the return of His Sons and daughters.

        <h3>Word From President</h3>
        <p>UNDER OPEN HEAVENS </p>
<p>This is a new month of operating under God’s open heaven. 
Let us yearn to be connected always to the source of our being by studying and staying in the Word of God. 
Allow the Holy Spirit to have a field day. 
 
<p>The Hand or the Glove? </p>
<p>I have a glove here in my hand. The glove cannot do anything by itself, but when my hand is in it, the glove can do many things. 
True, it is not the glove, but my hand in the glove that acts. 
The Christian is a glove. It is the Holy Spirit in us, the hand, who does the work. We have to make room for the hand so that every finger in the glove is filled.

	      <p>A GENERATION OF MULES</p> 
<p>"The church today is raising a whole generation of mules. They know how to sweat and to work hard but they don't know how to reproduce themselves." 
It's not known who said that, but it is a statement of incredible insight. Mules are hard workers. They have carried supplies, plowed fields, pulled wagons and transported people. The only problem is that they are almost always sterile and thus cannot reproduce. They are hard workers, but they are the end of the line. They do not produce more like themselves. The church is full of hard workers. They teach classes, serve the physical needs of others, clean up and mow the grass, cook, move tables, organize social activities, visit and even write letters and cards, and do a host of other things. There is just one problem. They don't "reproduce." They don't teach the gospel to the lost so others can become hard workers. They are the end of the line. 
The real job the Lord gave us is to go into the world and "reproduce ourselves" by making disciples of others (Mat_28:18-20). It is a tough lesson to realize that you may have worked hard and yet still haven't gotten the job done. Let us say it plainly. If we are not evangelizing, we are not doing the job completely. If we are nothing more than a generation of mules, we are on the road to extinction. Hup, Mule! Gee-Haw!!! 
</p>
<p>  SUPPORTING MISSIONS... All Giving is Not Willing </p>
<p>A woman once dreamed that she went to church, and after the service was over, a plate was held at the door for the contribution of members toward missions. 
This plate had the power of changing each person's gift into its real value in the sight of God. A gentleman put in a gold coin, which immediately turned into brass! He had given in order to be thought well off by others. A lady put in a quarter, which turned into a penny. She could have given far more, but only gave because that had been her custom.  
The dreamer felt sad to think that these gifts were not accepted by God. Just then a poor missionary came up and dropped in his penny. It immediately changed into gold! She had denied herself to give her all, because she loved the LORD JESUS CHRIST and HIS WORK!!! 
What can I also give in support of missions? 
Concerning the Macedonian church, Paul wrote…. 
 	 	 	 	 	“And not only as we had hoped, but they first gave 
themselves to the Lord and then to us by the will of God…. 2 Cor. 8:5” </br>
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	by Martin </p>
                                    
                    <p>  KEEP WATCHING!!! </p>
<p>As I walked on the lonely bridge, I kept humming that lovely hymn I learnt that day. As I got mid-way on the bridged, I tiredly leaned on it. There I had a nice view of the calm river flowing slowly and peacefully.  
While gazing at it admiringly, I saw a fish popping in and out of the river. Another followed and another.....following each other in 'chains'....it was really a nice view, and I was so glued to it that I found myself oblivious of my surrounding, forgetting that I was all by myself on that lonely bridge.  
Within a twinkling of an eye, I was distracted from this 'nice view'. I saw some two fishermen in a small boat casting a net into the river, nowhere than where the fishes were happily "playing". Without doubt, the fishermen had a bumpy harvest that day-the fishes have been trapped in the fishing net. Sadly, I watched the two happy fishermen making their way to the river bank, separating the 'good' fishes from the 'bad' ones.  
As I watched them quietly, I asked myself, if I were a fish, would I have been part of the good or the bad ones. For a while, although still gazing at the two happy men, I kept pondering on the question. Fear gripped me and I casted it out of my mind with the excuse that 'I'm not a fish'.  
On my way home, I found myself re-visiting the question, and there I knew I didn't have to be a fish, to ponder about this for a time will come when Jesus Christ like the fishermen will separate the good 'fishes' – mankind – from the bad ones. I then asked myself, will Jesus Christ be happy that day like the two fishermen were? The answer 'lies' with you.  
For although fishes have no means of choosing where to be, we as humans have the chance and power to choose where we wanna be...make a choice now, don't delay for the fishes never knew that the fishermen were coming for them that day. Watch and pray for no one knows when the "fisherman" - JESUS CHRIST cometh.

Ainsi, la lumiere de Jesus brille pour tout le monde, les bons et les mechants.  Certains ont pense que la sauveur etait venu seulement pour leur nation. Mais Dieu a bien fait comprendre que la lumiere de son salut est destine a tout le monde.
